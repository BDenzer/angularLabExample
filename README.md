# nodeLabExample
Playing with node and express a bit. This setup might be used to teach students about nodejs and routing.


#Setup:
Run:
```
npm install
```

#Misc:
Run
```
node app.js
``` 
in the project directory to serve the project. It should be available on localhost:9000 by default.

>If you get an error something along the lines of ``command 'node' not found`` try running ``nodejs app.js``
instead. If neither of these work, you likely don't have node installed.
